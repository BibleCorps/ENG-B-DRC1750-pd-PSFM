\mt1 The Book of Job
\im This Book takes its name from the holy man of whom it treats: who, according to the more probable opinion, was of the race of Esau; and the same as Jobab, king of Edom, mentioned Gen. 36.33. It is uncertain who was the writer of it. Some attribute it to Job himself; others to Moses, or some one of the prophets. In the Hebrew it is written in verse, from the beginning of the third chapter to the forty-second chapter.

\cl Job 1
\cd Job's virtue and riches. Satan by permission from God strippeth him of all his substance. His patience.
\p
\v 1 There was a man in the land of Hus, whose name was Job, and that man was simple and upright, and fearing God, and avoiding evil.\f + \fr 1:1 \fk Hus: \ft The land of Hus was a part of Edom; as appears from Lam. 4.21.\f*\f + \fr 1:1 \fk Simple: \ft That is, innocent, sincere, and without guile.\f*
\p
\v 2 And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters.
\p
\v 3 And his possession was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a family exceedingly great: and this man was great among all the people of the east.
\p
\v 4 And his sons went, and made a feast by houses, every one in his day. And sending, they called their three sisters, to eat and drink with them.\f + \fr 1:4 \fk And made a feast by houses: \ft That is, each made a feast in his own house and had his day, inviting the others, and their sisters.\f*
\p
\v 5 And when the days of their feasting were gone about, Job sent to them, and sanctified them: and rising up early, offered holocausts for every one of them. For he said: Lest perhaps my sons have sinned, and have blessed God in their hearts. So did Job all days.\f + \fr 1:5 \fk Blessed: \ft For greater horror of the very thought of blasphemy, the scripture both here and ver. 11, and in the following chapter, ver. 5 and 9, uses the word bless to signify its contrary.\f*
\p
\v 6 Now on a certain day, when the sons of God came to stand before the Lord, Satan also was present among them.\f + \fr 1:6 \fk The sons of God: \ft The angels.\f*\f + \fr 1:6 \fk Satan also, etc.: \ft This passage represents to us in a figure, accommodated to the ways and understandings of men, 1. The restless endeavours of Satan against the servants of God; 2. That he can do nothing without God's permission; 3. That God doth not permit him to tempt them above their strength: but assists them by his divine grace in such manner, that the vain efforts of the enemy only serve to illustrate their virtue and increase their merit.\f*
\p
\v 7 And the Lord said to him: Whence comest thou? And he answered and said: I have gone round about the earth, and walked through it.
\p
\v 8 And the Lord said to him: Hast thou considered my servant, Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a simple and upright man, and fearing God, and avoiding evil?
\p
\v 9 And Satan answering, said: Doth Job fear God in vain?
\p
\v 10 Hast thou not made a fence for him, and his house, and all his substance round about, blessed the works of his hands, and his possession hath increased on the earth?
\p
\v 11 But stretch forth thy hand a little, and touch all that he hath, and see if he bless thee not to thy face.
\p
\v 12 Then the Lord said to Satan: Behold, all that he hath is in thy hand: only put not forth thy hand upon his person. And Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord.
\p
\v 13 Now upon a certain day, when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine, in the house of their eldest brother,
\p
\v 14 There came a messenger to Job, and said: The oxen were ploughing, and the asses feeding beside them,
\p
\v 15 And the Sabeans rushed in, and took all away, and slew the servants with the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell thee.
\p
\v 16 And while he was yet speaking, another came, and said: The fire of God fell from heaven, and striking the sheep and the servants, hath consumed them; and I alone have escaped to tell thee.
\p
\v 17 And while he also was yet speaking, there came another, and said: The Chaldeans made three troops, and have fallen upon the camels, and taken them; moreover, they have slain the servants with the sword: and I alone have escaped to tell thee.
\p
\v 18 He was yet speaking, and behold another came in, and said: Thy sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their eldest brother,
\p
\v 19 A violent wind came on a sudden from the side of the desert, and shook the four corners of the house, and it fell upon thy children, and they are dead: and I alone have escaped to tell thee.
\p
\v 20 Then Job rose up, and rent his garments, and having shaven his head, fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,
\p
\v 21 And said: Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away: as it hath pleased the Lord, so is it done: blessed be the name of the Lord.
\p
\v 22 In all these things Job sinned not by his lips, nor spoke he any foolish thing against God.
\c 2
\cl Job 2
\cd Satan, by God's permission, striketh Job with ulcers from head to foot : his patience is still invincible.
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass, when on a certain day the sons of God came, and stood before the Lord, and Satan came amongst them, and stood in his sight,
\p
\v 2 That the Lord said to Satan: Whence comest thou? And he answered, and said: I have gone round about the earth, and walked through it.
\p
\v 3 And the Lord said to Satan: Hast thou considered my servant, Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a man simple and upright, and fearing God, and avoiding evil, and still keeping his innocence? But thou hast moved me against him, that I should afflict him without cause.
\p
\v 4 And Satan answered, and said: Skin for skin; and all that a man hath, he will give for his life:
\p
\v 5 But put forth thy hand, and touch his bone and his flesh, and then thou shalt see that he will bless thee to thy face.
\p
\v 6 And the Lord said to Satan: Behold, he is in thy hand, but yet save his life.
\p
\v 7 So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord, and struck Job with a very grievous ulcer, from the sole of the foot even to the top of his head:
\p
\v 8 And he took a potsherd and scraped the corrupt matter, sitting on a dunghill.
\p
\v 9 And his wife said to him: Dost thou still continue in thy simplicity? bless God and die.
\p
\v 10 And he said to her: Thou hast spoken like one of the foolish women: If we have received good things at the hand of God, why should we not receive evil? In all these things Job did not sin with his lips.
\p
\v 11 Now when Job's three friends heard all the evil that had befallen him, they came every one from his own place, Eliphaz, the Themanite, and Baldad, the Suhite, and Sophar, the Naamathite. For they had made an appointment to come together and visit him, and comfort him.
\p
\v 12 And when they had lifted up their eyes afar off, they knew him not, and crying out, they wept, and rending their garments, they sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.
\p
\v 13 And they sat with him on the ground seven day and seven nights and no man spoke to him a word: for they saw that his grief was very great.
\c 3
\cl Job 3
\cd Job expresseth his sense of the miseries of man's life, by cursing the day of his birth.
\p
\v 1 After this, Job opened his mouth, and cursed his day,\f + \fr 3:1 \fk Cursed his day: \ft Job cursed the day of his birth, not by way of wishing evil to any thing of God's creation; but only to express in a stronger manner his sense of human miseries in general, and of his own calamities in particular.\f*
\p
\v 2 And he said:
\p
\v 3 Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said: A man child is conceived.
\p
\v 4 Let that day be turned into darkness, let not God regard it from above, and let not the light shine upon it.
\p
\v 5 Let darkness, and the shadow of death, cover it, let a mist overspread it, and let it be wrapped up in bitterness.
\p
\v 6 Let a darksome whirlwind seize upon that night, let it not be counted in the days of the year, nor numbered in the months.
\p
\v 7 Let that night be solitary, and not worthy of praise.
\p
\v 8 Let them curse it who curse the day, who are ready to raise up a leviathan:
\p
\v 9 Let the stars be darkened with the mist thereof: let it expect light, and not see it, nor the rising of the dawning of the day:
\p
\v 10 Because it shut not up the doors of the womb that bore me, nor took away evils from my eyes.
\p
\v 11 Why did I not die in the womb? why did I not perish when I came out of the belly?
\p
\v 12 Why received upon the knees? why suckled at the breasts?
\p
\v 13 For now I should have been asleep and still, and should have rest in my sleep:
\p
\v 14 With kings and consuls of the earth, who build themselves solitudes:
\p
\v 15 Or with princes, that possess gold, and fill their houses with silver:
\p
\v 16 Or as a hidden untimely birth, I should not be; or as they that, being conceived, have not seen the light.
\p
\v 17 There the wicked cease from tumult, and there the wearied in strength are at rest.
\p
\v 18 And they sometime bound together without disquiet, have not heard the voice of the oppressor.
\p
\v 19 The small and great are there, and the servant is free from his master.
\p
\v 20 Why is light given to him that is in misery, and life to them that are in bitterness of soul?
\p
\v 21 That look for death, and it cometh not, as they that dig for a treasure:
\p
\v 22 And they rejoice exceedingly when they have found the grave?
\p
\v 23 To a man whose way is hidden, and God hath surrounded him with darkness?
\p
\v 24 Before I eat I sigh: and as overflowing waters, so is my roaring:
\p
\v 25 For the fear which I feared, hath come upon me: and that which I was afraid of, hath befallen me.
\p
\v 26 Have I not dissembled? have I not kept silence? have I not been quiet? and indignation is come upon me.
\c 4
\cl Job 4
\cd Eliphaz charges Job with impatience, and pretends that God never afflicts the innocent.
\p
\v 1 Then Eliphaz, the Themanite, answered, and said:
\p
\v 2 If we begin to speak to thee, perhaps thou wilt take it ill; but who can withhold the words he hath conceived?
\p
\v 3 Behold thou hast taught many, and thou hast strengthened the weary hands:
\p
\v 4 Thy words have confirmed them that were staggering, and thou hast strengthened the trembling knees:
\p
\v 5 But now the scourge is come upon thee, and thou faintest: It hath touched thee, and thou art troubled.
\p
\v 6 Where is thy fear, thy fortitude, thy patience, and the perfection of thy ways?
\p
\v 7 Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished being innocent? or when were the just destroyed?
\p
\v 8 On the contrary, I have seen those who work iniquity, and sow sorrows, and reap them,
\p
\v 9 Perishing by the blast of God, and consumed by the spirit of his wrath.
\p
\v 10 The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the lioness, and the teeth of the whelps of lions, are broken:
\p
\v 11 The tiger hath perished for want of prey, and the young lions are scattered abroad.
\p
\v 12 Now there was a word spoken to me in private, and my ears by stealth, as it were, received the veins of its whisper.
\p
\v 13 In the horror of a vision by night, when deep sleep is wont to hold men,
\p
\v 14 Fear seized upon me, and trembling, and all my bones were affrighted:
\p
\v 15 And when a spirit passed before me, the hair of my flesh stood up.
\p
\v 16 There stood one whose countenance I knew not, an image before my eyes, and I heard the voice, as it were, of a gentle wind.
\p
\v 17 Shall man be justified in comparison of God, or shall a man be more pure than his maker?\f + \fr 4:17 \fk Shall man be justified in comparison of God, etc: \ft These are the words which Eliphaz had heard from an angel, which, ver. 15, he calls a spirit.\f*
\p
\v 18 Behold, they that serve him are not steadfast, and in his angels he found wickedness:
\p
\v 19 How much more shall they that dwell in houses of clay, who have an earthly foundation, be consumed as with the moth?
\p
\v 20 From morning till evening they shall be cut down: and because no one understandeth, they shall perish for ever.
\p
\v 21 And they that shall be left, shall be taken away from them: they shall die, and not in wisdom.
\c 5
\cl Job 5
\cd EJiphaz proceeds in his charge, and exhorts Job to acknowledge his sins.
\p
\v 1 Call now, if there be any that will answer thee, and turn to some of the saints.
\p
\v 2 Anger indeed killeth the foolish, and envy slayeth the little one.
\p
\v 3 I have seen a fool with a strong root, and I cursed his beauty immediately.
\p
\v 4 His children shall be far from safety, and shall be destroyed in the gate, and there shall be none to deliver them.
\p
\v 5 Whose harvest the hungry shall eat, and the armed man shall take him by violence, and the thirsty shall drink up his riches.
\p
\v 6 Nothing upon earth is done without a cause, and sorrow doth not spring out of the ground.
\p
\v 7 Man is born to labour, and the bird to fly.
\p
\v 8 Wherefore I will pray to the Lord, and address my speech to God:
\p
\v 9 Who doth great things, and unsearchable and wonderful things without number:
\p
\v 10 Who giveth rain upon the face of the earth, and watereth all things with waters:
\p
\v 11 Who setteth up the humble on high, and comforteth with health those that mourn.
\p
\v 12 Who bringeth to nought the designs of the malignant, so that their hands cannot accomplish what they had begun:
\p
\v 13 Who catcheth the wise in their craftiness, and disappointeth the counsel of the wicked:
\p
\v 14 They shall meet with darkness in the day, and grope at noonday as in the night.
\p
\v 15 But he shall save the needy from the sword of their mouth, and the poor from the hand of the violent.
\p
\v 16 And to the needy there shall be hope, but iniquity shall draw in her mouth.
\p
\v 17 Blessed is the man whom God correcteth: refuse not, therefore, the chastising of the Lord.
\p
\v 18 For he woundeth, and cureth: he striketh, and his hands shall heal.
\p
\v 19 In six troubles he shall deliver thee, and in the seventh, evil shall not touch thee.
\p
\v 20 In famine he shall deliver thee from death; and in battle, from the hand of the sword.
\p
\v 21 Thou shalt be hidden from the scourge of the tongue: and thou shalt not fear calamity when it cometh.
\p
\v 22 In destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: and thou shalt not be afraid of the beasts of the earth.
\p
\v 23 But thou shalt have a covenant with the stones of the lands, and the beasts of the earth shall be at peace with thee.
\p
\v 24 And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle is in peace, and visiting thy beauty, thou shalt not sin.
\p
\v 25 Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be multiplied, and thy offspring like the grass of the earth.
\p
\v 26 Thou shalt enter into the grave in abundance, as a heap of wheat is brought in its season.
\p
\v 27 Behold, this is even so, as we have searched out: which thou having heard, consider it thoroughly in thy mind.
\c 6
\cl Job 6
\cd Job maintains his innocence, and complains of his friends.
\p
\v 1 But Job answered, and said:
\p
\v 2 O that my sins, whereby I have deserved wrath, and the calamity that I suffer, were weighed in a balance.\f + \fr 6:2 \fk My sins, etc: \ft He does not mean to compare his sufferings with his real sins: but with the imaginary crimes which his friends imputed to him: and especially with his wrath, or grief, expressed in the third chapter, which they so much accused. Though, as he tells them here, it bore no proportion with the greatness of his calamity.\f*
\p
\v 3 As the sand of the sea, this would appear heavier: therefore, my words are full of sorrow:
\p
\v 4 For the arrows of the Lord are in me, the rage whereof drinketh up my spirit, and the terrors of the Lord war against me.
\p
\v 5 Will the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or will the ox low when he standeth before a full manger?
\p
\v 6 Or can an unsavoury thing be eaten, that is not seasoned with salt? or can a man taste that which, when tasted, bringeth death?
\p
\v 7 The things which before my soul would not touch, now, through anguish, are my meats.
\p
\v 8 Who will grant that my request may come: and that God may give me what I look for?
\p
\v 9 And that he that hath begun may destroy me, that he may let loose his hand, and cut me off?
\p
\v 10 And that this may be my comfort, that afflicting me with sorrow, he spare not, nor I contradict the words of the Holy one.
\p
\v 11 For what is my strength, that I can hold out? or what is my end, that I should keep patience?
\p
\v 12 My strength is not the strength of stones, nor is my flesh of brass.
\p
\v 13 Behold there is no help for me in myself, and my familiar friends also are departed from me.
\p
\v 14 He that taketh away mercy from his friend, forsaketh the fear of the Lord.
\p
\v 15 My brethren have passed by me, as the torrent that passeth swiftly in the valleys.
\p
\v 16 They that fear the hoary frost, the snow shall fall upon them.
\p
\v 17 At the time when they shall be scattered they shall perish: and after it groweth hot, they shall be melted out of their place.
\p
\v 18 The paths of their steps are entangled: they shall walk in vain, and shall perish.
\p
\v 19 Consider the paths of Thema, the ways of Saba, and wait a little while.
\p
\v 20 They are confounded, because I have hoped: they are come also even unto me, and are covered with shame.
\p
\v 21 Now you are come: and now, seeing my affliction, you are afraid.
\p
\v 22 Did I say: Bring to me, and give me of your substance?
\p
\v 23 Or deliver me from the hand of the enemy, and rescue me out of the hand of the mighty?
\p
\v 24 Teach me, and I will hold my peace: and if I have been ignorant of any thing, instruct me.
\p
\v 25 Why have you detracted the words of truth, whereas there is none of you that can reprove me?
\p
\v 26 You dress up speeches only to rebuke, and you utter words to the wind.
\p
\v 27 You rush in upon the fatherless, and you endeavour to overthrow your friend.
\p
\v 28 However, finish what you have begun: give ear and see whether I lie.
\p
\v 29 Answer, I beseech you, without contention: and speaking that which is just, judge ye.
\p
\v 30 And you shall not find iniquity in my tongue, neither shall folly sound in my mouth.
\c 7
\cl Job 7
\cd Job declares the miseries of man's life : and addresses himself to God.
\p
\v 1 The life of man upon earth is a warfare, and his days are like the days of a hireling.
\p
\v 2 As a servant longeth for the shade, as the hireling looketh for the end of his work;
\p
\v 3 So I also have had empty months, and have numbered to myself wearisome nights.
\p
\v 4 If I lie down to sleep, I shall say: When shall I rise? and again, I shall look for the evening, and shall be filled with sorrows even till darkness.
\p
\v 5 My flesh is clothed with rottenness and the filth of dust; my skin is withered and drawn together.
\p
\v 6 My days have passed more swiftly than the web is cut by the weaver, and are consumed without any hope.
\p
\v 7 Remember that my life is but wind, and my eye shall not return to see good things.
\p
\v 8 Nor shall the sight of man behold me: thy eyes are upon me, and I shall be no more.
\p
\v 9 As a cloud is consumed, and passeth away: so he that shall go down to hell shall not come up.
\p
\v 10 Nor shall he return any more into his house, neither shall his place know him any more
\p
\v 11 Wherefore, I will not spare my mouth, I will speak in the affliction of my spirit: I will talk with the bitterness of my soul.
\p
\v 12 Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou hast enclosed me in a prison?
\p
\v 13 If I say: My bed shall comfort me, and I shall be relieved, speaking with myself on my couch:
\p
\v 14 Thou wilt frighten me with dreams, and terrify me with visions.
\p
\v 15 So that my soul rather chooseth hanging, and my bones death.
\p
\v 16 I have done with hope, I shall now live no longer: spare me, for my days are nothing.
\p
\v 17 What is a man, that thou shouldst magnify him or why dost thou set thy heart upon him?
\p
\v 18 Thou visitest him early in the morning, and thou provest him suddenly.
\p
\v 19 How long wilt thou not spare me, nor suffer me to swallow down my spittle?
\p
\v 20 I have sinned: what shall I do to thee, O keeper of men? why hast thou set me opposite to thee. and am I become burdensome to myself?
\p
\v 21 Why dost thou not remove my sin, and why dost thou not take away my iniquity? Behold now I shall sleep in the dust: and if thou seek me in the morning, I shall not be.
\c 8
\cl Job 8
\cd Baldad, under pretence of defending the justice of God, accuses Job, and exhorts him to return to God.
\p
\v 1 Then Baldad, the Suhite, answered, and said:
\p
\v 2 How long wilt thou speak these things, and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?
\p
\v 3 Doth God pervert judgment, or doth the Almighty overthrow that which is just?
\p
\v 4 Although thy children have sinned against him, and he hath left them in the hand of their iniquity:
\p
\v 5 Yet if thou wilt arise early to God, and wilt beseech the Almighty:
\p
\v 6 If thou wilt walk clean and upright, he will presently awake unto thee, and will make the dwelling of thy justice peaceable:
\p
\v 7 In so much, that if thy former things were small thy latter things would be multiplied exceedingly.
\p
\v 8 For inquire of the former generation, and search diligently into the memory of the fathers:
\p
\v 9 (For we are but of yesterday, and are ignorant that our days upon earth are but a shadow)
\p
\v 10 And they shall teach thee: they shall speak to thee, and utter words out of their hearts.
\p
\v 11 Can the rush be green without moisture? or sedge bush grow without water?
\p
\v 12 When it is yet in flower, and is not plucked up with the hand, it withereth before all herbs.
\p
\v 13 Even so are the ways of all that forget God, and the hope of the hypocrite shall perish:
\p
\v 14 His folly shall not please him, and his trust shall be like the spider's web.
\p
\v 15 He shall lean upon his house, and it shall not stand: he shall prop it up, and it shall not rise:
\p
\v 16 He seemeth to have moisture before the sun cometh; and at his rising, his blossom shall shoot forth.
\p
\v 17 His roots shall be thick upon a heap of stones; and among the stones he shall abide.
\p
\v 18 If one swallow him up out of his place, he shall deny him, and shall say: I know thee not.
\p
\v 19 For this is the joy of his way, that others may spring again out of the earth.
\p
\v 20 God will not cast away the simple, nor reach out his hand to the evil doer:
\p
\v 21 Until thy mouth be filled with laughter, and thy lips with rejoicing.
\p
\v 22 They that hate thee, shall be clothed with confusion: and the dwelling of the wicked shall not stand.

\cl Job 9
\cd Job acknowledges God's justice : although he often afflicts the innocent.
\p
\v 1 And Job answered, and said:
\p
\v 2 Indeed I know it is so, and that man cannot be justified, compared with God.
\p
\v 3 If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one for a thousand.
\p
\v 4 He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath resisted him, and hath had peace?
\p
\v 5 Who hath removed mountains, and they whom he overthrew in his wrath, knew it not.
\p
\v 6 Who shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.
\p
\v 7 Who commandeth the sun, and it riseth not: and shutteth up the stars, as it were, under a seal:
\p
\v 8 Who alone spreadeth out the heavens, and walketh upon the waves of the sea.
\p
\v 9 Who maketh Arcturus, and Orion, and Hyades, and the inner parts of the south.\f + \fr 9:9 \fk Arcturus, etc: \ft These are names of stars or constellations. In Hebrew, Ash, Cesil, and Cimah. See note chap. 38, ver. 31.\f*
\p
\v 10 Who doth things great and incomprehensible, and wonderful, of which there is no number.
\p
\v 11 If he come to me, I shall not see him: if he depart, I shall not understand.
\p
\v 12 If he examine on a sudden, who shall answer him? or who can say: Why dost thou so?
\p
\v 13 God, whose wrath no man can resist, and under whom they stoop that bear up the world.
\p
\v 14 What am I then, that I should answer him, and have words with him?
\p
\v 15 I, who although I should have any just thing, would not answer, but would make supplication to my judge.
\p
\v 16 And if he should hear me when I call, I should not believe that he had heard my voice.
\p
\v 17 For he shall crush me in a whirlwind, and multiply my wounds even without cause.\f + \fr 9:17 \fk Without cause: \ft That is, without my knowing the cause: or without any crime of mine.\f*
\p
\v 18 He alloweth not my spirit to rest, and he filleth me with bitterness.
\p
\v 19 If strength be demanded, he is most strong: if equity of judgment, no man dare bear witness for me.
\p
\v 20 If I would justify myself, my own mouth shall condemn me: if I would shew myself innocent, he shall prove me wicked.
\p
\v 21 Although I should be simple, even this my soul shall be ignorant of, and I shall be weary of my life.
\p
\v 22 One thing there is that I have spoken, both the innocent and the wicked he consumeth.
\p
\v 23 If he scourge, let him kill at once, and not laugh at the pains of the innocent.
\p
\v 24 The earth is given into the hand of the wicked, he covereth the face of the judges thereof: and if it be not he, who is it then?
\p
\v 25 My days have been swifter than a post: they have fled away and have not seen good.
\p
\v 26 They have passed by as ships carrying fruits, as an eagle flying to the prey.
\p
\v 27 If I say: I will not speak so: I change my face, and am tormented with sorrow.
\p
\v 28 I feared all my works, knowing that thou didst not spare the offender.
\p

\v 3 Doth it seem good to thee that thou shouldst calumniate me, and oppress me, the work of thy own hands, and help the counsel of the wicked?
\p
\v 4 Hast thou eyes of flesh: or, shalt thou see as man seeth?
\p
\v 5 Are thy days as the days of man, and are thy years as the times of men:

\p
\v 7 And shouldst know that I have done no wicked thing, whereas there is no man that can deliver out of thy hand?
\p
\v 8 Thy hands have made me, and fashioned me wholly round about, and dost thou thus cast me down headlong on a sudden?
\p
\v 9 Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay, and thou wilt bring me into dust
\p
\v 10 Hast thou not milked me as milk, and curdled me like cheese?
\p

\cd Job, to defend himself from the unjust judgments of his friends, gives a sincere account of his own virtues.

\p
\v 2 For what part should God from above have in me, and what inheritance the Almighty from on high?
\p
\v 3 Is not destruction to the wicked, and aversion to them that work iniquity?
\p
\v 4 Doth not he consider my ways, and number all my steps?
\p
\v 5 If I have walked in vanity, and my foot hath made haste to deceit:
\p
\v 6 Let him weigh me in a just balance, and let God know my simplicity.
\p
\v 7 If my step hath turned out of the way, and if my heart hath followed my eyes, and if a spot hath cleaved to my hands:

\v 8 Then let me sow and let another reap: and let my offspring be rooted out.
\p
\v 9 If my heart hath been deceived upon a woman, and if I have laid wait at my friend's door:
\p
\v 10 Let my wife be the harlot of another, and let other men lie with her.
\p
\v 11 For this is a heinous crime, and a most grievous iniquity.
\p
\v 12 It is a fire that devoureth even to destruction, and rooteth up all things that spring.
\p
\v 13 If I have despised to abide judgment with my manservant, or my maidservant, when they had any controversy against me:

\v 14 For what shall I do when God shall rise to judge? and when he shall examine, what shall I answer him?
\p
\v 15 Did not he that made me in the womb make him also: and did not one and the same form me in the womb?
\p
\v 16 If I have denied to the poor what they desired, and have made the eyes of the widow wait:
\p
\v 17 If I have eaten my morsel alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof:
\p
\v 18 (For from my infancy mercy grew up with me: and it came out with me from my mother's womb:)

\v 22 Let my shoulder fall from its joint, and let my arm with its bones be broken.

\cl Job 32
\cd Eliu is angry with Job and his friends. He boasts of himself.
\p
\v 1 So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he seemed just to himself.
\p
\v 2 And Eliu the son of Barachel the Buzite of the kindred of Ram, was angry and was moved to indignation: now he was angry against Job, because he said he was just before God.
\p
\v 3 And he was angry with his friends, because they had not found a reasonable answer, but only had condemned Job.
\p
\v 4 So Eliu waited while Job was speaking because they were his elders that were speaking.
\p
\v 5 But when he saw that the three were not able to answer, he was exceedingly angry.
\p
\v 6 Then Eliu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered, and said: I am younger in days, and you are more ancient, therefore hanging down my head, I was afraid to shew you my opinion.
\p
\v 7 For I hoped that greater age would speak, and that a multitude of years would teach wisdom.
\p
\v 8 But, as I see, there is a spirit in men, and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth understanding.
\p
\v 9 They that are aged are not the wise men, neither do the ancients understand judgment.
\p
\v 10 Therefore I will speak: Hearken to me, I also will shew you my wisdom.
\p
\v 11 For I have waited for your words, I have given ear to your wisdom, as long as you were disputing in words.
\p
\v 12 And as long as I thought you said some thing, I considered: but, as I see, there is none of you that can convince Job, and answer his words.
\p
\v 13 Lest you should say: We have found wisdom, God hath cast him down, not man.
\p
\v 14 He hath spoken nothing to me, and I will not answer him according to your words.
\p
\v 15 They were afraid, and answered no more, and they left off speaking.
\p
\v 16 Therefore because I have waited, and they have not spoken: they stood, and answered no more:
\p
\v 17 I also will answer my part, and will shew my knowledge.
\p
\v 18 For I am full of matter to speak of, and the spirit of my bowels straiteneth me.
\p
\v 19 Behold, my belly is as new wine which wanteth vent, which bursteth the new vessels.
\p
\v 20 I will speak and take breath a little: I will open my lips, and will answer.

\p
\v 1 Hear therefore, O Job, my speeches, and hearken to all my words.
\p
\v 2 Behold now I have opened my mouth, let my tongue speak within my jaws.
\p
\v 3 My words are from my upright heart, and my lips shall speak a pure sentence.
\p
\v 4 The spirit of God made me, and the breath of the Almighty gave me life.
\p
\v 5 If thou canst, answer me, and stand up against my face.
\p
\v 6 Behold God hath made me as well as thee, and of the same clay I also was formed.
\p
\v 7 But yet let not my wonder terrify thee, and let not my eloquence be burdensome to thee.
\p
\v 8 Now thou hast said in my hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words:
\p
\v 9 I am clean, and without sin: I am unspotted, and there is no iniquity in me.
\p
\v 10 Because he hath found complaints against me, therefore he hath counted me for his enemy.
\p
\v 11 He hath put my feet in the stocks, he hath observed all my paths.
\p
\v 12 Now this is the thing in which thou art not justified: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.
\p
\v 13 Dost thou strive against him, because he hath not answered thee to all words?
\p
\v 14 God speaketh once, and repeateth not the selfsame thing the second time.
\p
\v 15 By a dream in a vision by night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, and they are sleeping in their beds:
\p
\v 16 Then he openeth the ears of men, and teaching instructeth them in what they are to learn.
\p
\v 17 That he may withdraw a man from the things he is doing, and may deliver him from pride.
\p
\v 18 Rescuing his soul from corruption: and his life from passing to the sword.
\p
\v 19 He rebuketh also by sorrow in the bed, and he maketh all his bones to wither.
\p
\v 20 Bread becometh abominable to him in his life, and to his soul the meat which before he desired.
\p
\v 21 His flesh shall be consumed away, and his bones that were covered shall be made bare.
\p
\v 22 His soul hath drawn near to corruption, and his life to the destroyers.
\p
\v 23 If there shall be an angel speaking for him, one among thousands, to declare man's uprightness,
\p
\v 24 He shall have mercy on him, and shall say: Deliver him, that he may not go down to corruption: I have found wherein I may be merciful to him.
\p
\v 25 His flesh is consumed with punishments, let him return to the days of his youth.
\p
\v 26 He shall pray to God, and he will be gracious to him: and he shall see his face with joy, and he will render to man his justice.
\p
\v 27 He shall look upon men, and shall say: I have sinned, and indeed I have offended, and I have not received what I have deserved.
\p
\v 28 He hath delivered his soul from going into destruction, that it may live and see the light.
\p
\v 29 Behold, all these things God worketh three times within every one.
\p
\v 30 That he may withdraw their souls from corruption, and enlighten them with the light of the living.
\p
\v 31 Attend, Job, and hearken to me, and hold thy peace, whilst I speak.

\cl Job 34
\cd Eliu charges Job with blasphemy: and sets forth the power and justice of God.
\p
\v 1 And Eliu continued his discourse, and said:
\p
\v 2 Hear ye, wise men, my words, and ye learned, hearken to me:
\p
\v 3 For the ear trieth words, and the mouth discerneth meats by the taste.
\p
\v 4 Let us choose to us judgment, and let us see among ourselves what is the best.
\p
\v 5 For Job hath said: I am just, and God hath overthrown my judgment.
\p
\v 6 For in judging me there is a lie: my arrow is violent without any sin.
\p
\v 7 What man is there like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?
\p
\v 8 Who goeth in company with them that work iniquity, and walketh with wicked men?
\p
\v 9 For he hath said: Man shall not please God, although he run with him.
\p
\v 10 Therefore, ye men of understanding, hear me: far from God be wickedness, and iniquity from the Almighty.
\p
\v 11 For he will render to a man his work, and according to the ways of every one he will reward them.
\p
\v 12 For in very deed God will not condemn without cause, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.
\p
\v 13 What other hath he appointed over the earth? or whom hath he set over the world which he made?
\p
\v 14 If he turn his heart to him, he shall draw his spirit and breath unto himself.
\p
\v 15 All flesh shall perish together, and man shall return into ashes.
\p
\v 16 If then thou hast understanding, hear what is said, and hearken to the voice of my words.
\p
\v 17 Can he be healed that loveth not judgment? and how dost thou so far condemn him that is just?
\p
\v 18 Who saith to the king: Thou art an apostate: who calleth rulers ungodly:
\p
\v 19 Who accepteth not the persons of princes: nor hath regarded the tyrant, when he contended against the poor man: for all are the work of his hands.
\p
\v 20 They shall suddenly die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and they shall pass, and take away the violent without hand.
\p
\v 21 For his eyes are upon the ways of men, and he considereth all their steps.
\p
\v 22 There is no darkness, and there is no shadow of death, where they may be hid who work iniquity.
\p
\v 23 For it is no longer in the power of man to enter into judgment with God.
\p
\v 24 He shall break in pieces many and innumerable, and shall make others to stand in their stead.
\p
\v 25 For he knoweth their works: and therefore he shall bring night on them, and they shall be destroyed.
\p
\v 26 He hath struck them, as being wicked, in open sight.
\p
\v 27 Who as it were on purpose have revolted from him, and would not understand all his ways:
\p
\v 28 So that they caused the cry of the needy to come to him, and he heard the voice of the poor.
\p
\v 29 For when he granteth peace, who is there that can condemn? When he hideth his countenance, who is there that can behold him, whether it regard nations, or all men?
\p
\v 30 Who maketh a man that is a hypocrite to reign for the sins of the people?
\p
\v 31 Seeing then I have spoken of God, I will not hinder thee in thy turn.
\p
\v 32 If I have erred, teach thou me: if I have spoken iniquity, I will add no more.
\p
\v 33 Doth God require it of thee, because it hath displeased thee? for thou begannest to speak, and not I: but if thou know any thing better, speak.
\p
\v 34 Let men of understanding speak to me, and let a wise man hearken to me.
\p
\v 35 But Job hath spoken foolishly, and his words sound not discipline.
\p
\v 36 My father, let Job be tried even to the end: cease not from the man of iniquity.
\p
\v 37 Because he addeth blasphemy upon his sins, let him be tied fast in the mean time amongst us: and then let him provoke God to judgment with his speeches.

\v 2 Doth thy thought seem right to thee, that thou shouldst say: I am more just than God?
\p
\v 3 For thou saidst: That which is right doth not please thee: or what will it profit thee if I sin?
\p
\v 4 Therefore I will answer thy words, and thy friends with thee.
\p
\v 5 Look up to heaven and see, and behold the sky, that it is higher than thee.
\p
\v 6 If thou sin, what shalt thou hurt him? and if thy iniquities be multiplied, what shalt thou do against him?
\p
\v 7 And if thou do justly, what shalt thou give him, or what shall he receive of thy hand?
\p
\v 8 Thy wickedness may hurt a man that is like thee: and thy justice may help the son of man.
\p
\v 9 By reason of the multitude of oppressors they shall cry out: and shall wail for the violence of the arm of tyrants.
\p
\v 10 And he hath not said: Where is God, who made me, who hath given songs in the night?
\p
\v 11 Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and instructeth us more than the fowls of the air.
\p
\v 12 There shall they cry, and he will not hear, because of the pride of evil men.
\p
\v 13 God therefore will not hear in vain, and the Almighty will look into the causes of every one.
\p
\v 14 Yea, when thou shalt say: He considereth not: be judged before him, and expect him.
\p

\v 3 Gird up thy loins like a man: I will ask thee, and answer thou me.
\p
\v 4 Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? tell me if thou hast understanding.
\p
\v 5 Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest or who hath stretched the line upon it?
\p
\v 6 Upon what are its bases grounded? or who laid the corner stone thereof,
\p
\v 7 When the morning stars praised me together, and all the sons of God made a joyful melody?
\p
\v 8 Who shut up the sea with doors, when it broke forth as issuing out of the womb:
\p
\v 9 When I made a cloud the garment thereof, and wrapped it in a mist as in swaddling bands?
\p
\v 10 I set my bounds around it, and made it bars and doors:
\p
\v 11 And I said: Hitherto thou shalt come, and shalt go no further, and here thou shalt break thy swelling waves.
\p
\v 12 Didst thou since thy birth command the morning, and shew the dawning of the day its place?
\p
\v 13 And didst thou hold the extremities of the earth shaking them, and hast thou shaken the ungodly out of it?
\p
\v 14 The seal shall be restored as clay, and shall stand as a garment.
\p
\v 15 From the wicked their light shall be taken away, and the high arm shall be broken.
\p
\v 16 Hast thou entered into the depths of the sea, and walked in the lowest parts of the deep?
\p
\v 17 Have the gates of death been opened to thee, and hast thou seen the darksome doors?
\p
\v 18 Hast thou considered the breadth of the earth? tell me, if thou knowest all things?
\p
\v 19 Where is the way where light dwelleth, and where is the place of darkness?
\p
\v 20 That thou mayst bring every thing to its own bounds, and understand the paths of the house thereof.
\p
\v 21 Didst thou know then that thou shouldst be born? and didst thou know the number of thy days?
\p
\v 22 Hast thou entered into the storehouses of the snow, or hast thou beheld the treasures of the hail:
\p
\v 23 Which I have prepared for the time of the enemy, against the day of battle and war?
\p
\v 24 By what way is the light spread, and heat divided upon the earth?
\p
\v 25 Who gave a course to violent showers, or a way for noisy thunder:
\p
\v 26 That it should rain on the earth without man in the wilderness, where no mortal dwelleth:
\p
\v 27 That it should fill the desert and desolate land, and should bring forth green grass?
\p
\v 28 Who is the father of rain? or who begot the drops of dew?
\p
\v 29 Out of whose womb came the ice? and the frost from heaven who hath gendered it?
\p
\v 30 The waters are hardened like a stone, and the surface of the deep is congealed.
\p
\v 31 Shalt thou be able to join together the shining stars the Pleiades, or canst thou stop the turning about of Arcturus?\f + \fr 38:31 \fk Pleiades: \ft Hebrew, Cimah. A cluster of seven stars in the constellation Taurus or the Bull. Arcturus, a bright star in the constellation Bootes. The Hebrew name Cesil, is variously interpreted; by some, Orion; by others, the Great Bear is understood.\f*
\p
\v 32 Canst thou bring forth the day star in its time, and make the evening star to rise upon the children of the earth?
\p
\v 33 Dost thou know the order of heaven, and canst thou set down the reason thereof on the earth?
\p
\v 34 Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that an abundance of waters may cover thee?
\p
\v 35 Canst thou send lightnings, and will they go, and will they return and say to thee: Here we are?
\p
\v 36 Who hath put wisdom in the heart of man? or who gave the cock understanding?\f + \fr 38:36 \fk Understanding: \ft That instinct by which he distinguishes the times of crowing in the night.\f*
\p
\v 37 Who can declare the order of the heavens, or who can make the harmony of heaven to sleep?
\p
\v 38 When was the dust poured on the earth, and the clods fastened together?
\p
\v 39 Wilt thou take the prey for the lioness, and satisfy the appetite of her whelps,
\p
\v 40 When they couch in the dens and lie in wait in holes?
\p
\v 41 Who provideth food for the raven, when her young ones cry to God, wandering about, because they have no meat?
\c 39
\cl Job 39
\cd The wonders of the power and providence of God in many of his creatures.
\p
\v 1 Knowest thou the time when the wild goats bring forth among the rocks, or hast thou observed the hinds when they fawn?
\p
\v 2 Hast thou numbered the months of their conceiving, or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?
\p
\v 3 They bow themselves to bring forth young, and they cast them, and send forth roarings.
\p
\v 4 Their young are weaned and go to feed: they go forth, and return not to them.
\p
\v 5 Who hath sent out the wild ass free, and who hath loosed his bonds?
\p
\v 6 To whom I have given a house in the wilderness, and his dwellings in the barren land.
\p
\v 7 He scorneth the multitude of the city, he heareth not the cry of the driver.
\p
\v 8 He looketh round about the mountains of his pasture, and seeketh for every green thing.
\p
\v 9 Shall the rhinoceros be willing to serve thee, or will he stay at thy crib?
\p
\v 10 Canst thou bind the rhinoceros with thy thong to plough, or will he break the clods of the valleys after thee?
\p
\v 11 Wilt thou have confidence in his great strength, and leave thy labours to him?
\p
\v 12 Wilt thou trust him that he will render thee the seed, and gather it into thy barnfloor?
\p
\v 13 The wing of the ostrich is like the wings of the heron, and of the hawk.
\p
\v 14 When she leaveth her eggs on the earth, thou perhaps wilt warm them in the dust.
\p
\v 15 She forgetteth that the foot may tread upon them, or that the beasts of the field may break them.
\p
\v 16 She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not hers, she hath laboured in vain, no fear constraining her.
\p
\v 17 For God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he given her understanding.
\p
\v 18 When time shall be, she setteth up her wings on high: she scorneth the horse and his rider.
\p
\v 19 Wilt thou give strength to the horse or clothe his neck with neighing?
\p
\v 20 Wilt thou lift him up like the locusts? the glory of his nostrils is terror.
\p
\v 21 He breaketh up the earth with his hoof, he pranceth boldly, he goeth forward to meet armed men.
\p
\v 22 He despiseth fear, he turneth not his back to the sword.
\p
\v 23 Above him shall the quiver rattle, the spear and shield shall glitter.
\p
\v 24 Chasing and raging he swalloweth the ground, neither doth he make account when the noise of the trumpet soundeth.
\p
\v 25 When he heareth the trumpet he saith: Ha, ha: he smelleth the battle afar off, the encouraging of the captains, and the shouting of the army.
\p
\v 26 Doth the hawk wax feathered by thy wisdom, spreading her wings to the south?
\p
\v 27 Will the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest in high places?
\p
\v 28 She abideth among the rocks, and dwelleth among cragged flints, and stony hills, where there is no access.
\p
\v 29 From thence she looketh for the prey, and her eyes behold afar off.
\p
\v 30 Her young ones shall suck up blood: and wheresoever the carcass shall be, she is immediately there.
\p
\v 31 And the Lord went on, and said to Job:
\p
\v 32 Shall he that contendeth with God be so easily silenced? surely he that reproveth God, ought to answer him.
\p
\v 33 Then Job answered the Lord, and said:
\p
\v 34 What can I answer, who hath spoken inconsiderately? I will lay my hand upon my mouth.\f + \fr 39:34 \fk Spoken inconsiderately: \ft If we discuss all Job's words (saith St. Gregory), we shall find nothing impiously spoken; as may be gathered from the words of the Lord himself, chap. 42, ver. 7, 8; but what was reprehensible in him, was the manner of expressing himself at times, speaking too much of his own affliction, and too little of God's goodness towards him, which here he acknowledges as inconsiderate.\f*
\p
\v 35 One thing I have spoken, which I wish I had not said: and another, to which I will add no more.
\c 40
\cl Job 40
\cd Of the power of God in the behemoth and the leviathan.
\p
\v 1 And the Lord answering Job out of the whirlwind, said:
\p
\v 2 Gird up thy loins like a man: I will ask thee, and do thou tell me.
\p
\v 3 Wilt thou make void my judgment: and condemn me, that thou mayst be justified?
\p
\v 4 And hast thou an arm like God, and canst thou thunder with a voice like him?
\p
\v 5 Clothe thyself with beauty, and set thyself up on high, and be glorious, and put on goodly garments.
\p
\v 6 Scatter the proud in thy indignation, and behold every arrogant man, and humble him.
\p
\v 7 Look on all that are proud, and confound them, and crush the wicked in their place,
\p
\v 8 Hide them in the dust together, and plunge their faces into the pit.
\p
\v 9 Then I will confess that thy right hand is able to save thee.
\p
\v 10 Behold behemoth whom I made with thee, he eateth grass like an ox.\f + \fr 40:10 \fk Behemoth: \ft In Hebrew, behema, which signifies in general an animal; but many authors explain, that here it is put for the elephant.\f*
\p
\v 11 His strength is in his loins, and his force in the navel of his belly.
\p
\v 12 He setteth up his tail like a cedar, the sinews of his testicles are wrapped together.
\p
\v 13 His bones are like pipes of brass, his gristle like plates of iron.
\p
\v 14 He is the beginning of the ways of God, who made him, he will apply his sword.\f + \fr 40:14 \fk He will apply his sword: \ft This text is variously explained: some explain the sword, the horn given to the animal for his defence: others, the power that God hath given to the animal for his defence: others, the power that God hath given to man to slay him, notwithstanding his great size and strength.\f*
\p
\v 15 To him the mountains bring forth grass: there all the beasts of the field shall play.
\p
\v 16 He sleepeth under the shadow, in the covert of the reed, and in moist places.
\p
\v 17 The shades cover his shadow, the willows of the brook shall compass him about.
\p
\v 18 Behold, he will drink up a river, and not wonder: and he trusteth that the Jordan may run into his mouth.
\p
\v 19 In his eyes as with a hook he shall take him, and bore through his nostrils with stakes.
\p
\v 20 Canst thou draw out the leviathan with a hook, or canst thou tie his tongue with a cord?\f + \fr 40:20 \fk Leviathan: \ft The whale or some sea monster.\f*
\p
\v 21 Canst thou put a ring in his nose, or bore through his jaw with a buckle?
\p
\v 22 Will he make many supplications to thee, or speak soft words to thee?
\p
\v 23 Will he make a covenant with thee, and wilt thou take him to be a servant for ever?
\p
\v 24 Shalt thou play with him as with a bird, or tie him up for thy handmaids?
\p
\v 25 Shall friends cut him in pieces, shall merchants divide him?
\p
\v 26 Wilt thou fill nets with his skin, and the cabins of fishes with his head?
\p
\v 27 Lay thy hand upon him: remember the battle, and speak no more.
\p
\v 28 Behold his hope shall fail him, and in the sight of all he shall be cast down.

\cl Job 41
\cd A further description of the leviathan.
\p
\v 1 I will not stir him up, like one that is cruel, for who can resist my countenance?
\p
\v 2 Who hath given me before that I should repay him? All things that are under heaven are mine.
\p
\v 3 I will not spare him, nor his mighty words, and framed to make supplication.
\p
\v 4 Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can go into the midst of his mouth?
\p
\v 5 Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about.
\p
\v 6 His body is like molten shields, shut close up with scales pressing upon one another.
\p
\v 7 One is joined to another, and not so much as any air can come between them:
\p
\v 8 They stick one to another and they hold one another fast, and shall not be separated.
\p
\v 9 His sneezing is like the shining of fire, and his eyes like the eyelids of the morning.
\p
\v 10 Out of his mouth go forth lamps, like torches of lighted fire.
\p
\v 11 Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, like that of a pot heated and boiling.
\p
\v 12 His breath kindleth coals, and a flame cometh forth out of his mouth.
\p
\v 13 In his neck strength shall dwell, and want goeth before his face.
\p
\v 14 The members of his flesh cleave one to another: he shall send lightnings against him, and they shall not be carried to another place.
\p
\v 15 His heart shall be as hard as a stone, and as firm as a smith's anvil.
\p
\v 16 When he shall raise him up, the angels shall fear, and being affrighted shall purify themselves.\f + \fr 41:16 \fk Angels: \ft Elim, Hebrew: which signifies here, the mighty, the most valiant, shall fear this monstrous fish, and in their fear shall seek to be purified.\f*
\p
\v 17 When a sword shall lay at him, it shall not be able to hold, nor a spear, nor a breastplate.
\p
\v 18 For he shall esteem iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.
\p
\v 19 The archer shall not put him to flight, the stones of the sling are to him like stubble.
\p
\v 20 As stubble will he esteem the hammer, and he will laugh him to scorn who shaketh the spear.
\p
\v 21 The beams of the sun shall be under him, and he shall strew gold under him like mire.\f + \fr 41:21 \fk Under him: \ft He shall not value the beams of the sun; and gold to him shall be like mire.\f*
\p
\v 22 He shall make the deep sea to boil like a pot, and shall make it as when ointments boil.
\p
\v 23 A path shall shine after him, he shall esteem the deep as growing old.\f + \fr 41:23 \fk The deep as growing old: \ft Growing hoary, as it were with the froth which he leaves behind him.\f*
\p
\v 24 There is no power upon earth that can be compared with him who was made to fear no one.
\p

\cl Job 42
\cd Job submits himself. God pronounces in his favour. Job offers sacrifice for his friends. He is blessed with riches and children, and dies happily,
\p
\v 1 Then Job answered the Lord, and said:
\p
\v 2 I know that thou canst do all things, and no thought is hid from thee.
\p
\v 3 Who is this that hideth counsel without knowledge? Therefore I have spoken unwisely, and things that above measure exceeded my knowledge.
\p
\v 4 Hear, and I will speak: I will ask thee, and do thou tell me.
\p
\v 5 With the hearing of the ear, I have heard thee, but now my eye seeth thee.
\p
\v 6 Therefore I reprehend myself, and do penance in dust and ashes.
\p
\v 7 And after the Lord had spoken these words to Job, he said to Eliphaz the Themanite: My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends, because you have not spoken the thing that is right before me, as my servant Job hath.
\p
\v 8 Take unto you therefore seven oxen and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer for yourselves a holocaust, and my servant Job shall pray for you: his face I will accept, that folly be not imputed to you: for you have not spoken right things before me, as my servant Job hath.
\p
\v 9 So Eliphaz the Themanite, and Baldad the Suhite, and Sophar the Naamathite went, and did as the Lord had spoken to them, and the Lord accepted the face of Job.
\p
\v 10 The Lord also was turned at the penance of Job, when he prayed for his friends. And the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before.
\p
\v 11 And all his brethren came to him, and all his sisters, and all that knew him before, and they ate bread with him in his house: and bemoaned him, and comforted him upon all the evil that God had brought upon him. And every man gave him one ewe, and one earring of gold.
\p
\v 12 And the Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning. And he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.
\p
\v 13 And he had seven sons, and three daughters.
\p
\v 14 And he called the name of one Dies, and the name of the second Cassia, and the name of the third Cornustibii.
\p
\v 15 And there were not found in all the earth women so beautiful as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.
\p
\v 16 And Job lived after these things, a hundred and forty years, and he saw his children, and his children's children, unto the fourth generation, and he died an old man, and full of days.
